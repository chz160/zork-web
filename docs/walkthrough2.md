ClubFloyd Transcript:  
**_Zork I_ by Marc Blank and Dave Lebling**  
**_Zork: A Troll's-Eye View_ by Dylan O'Donnell**  
As played on ifMUD on April 3 & 10, 2016 The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.   
  
Below is a transcript of _Zork I_ written by Marc Blank and Dave Lebling, and _Zork: A Troll's-Eye View_ written by Dylan O'Donnell. _Zork I_ was released by Infocom in 1980; it ranked 22nd and 41st in the 2011 and 2015 editions of the Interactive Fiction Top 50 of All Time, respectively. _Zork: A Troll's-Eye View_ is a short, fun game inspired by _Zork I_ that was released in 1998. You can learn more about the games, including how to download them, by visiting the IFDB pages: [Zork I](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=0dbnusxunq7fw5ro) and [Zork: A Troll's-Eye View](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=1ya4d9l464gpy7sh).   
  
WARNING! Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead, you might want to return to the [interactive fiction page](https://allthingsjacq.com/interactive_fiction.html).

|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "So, last night I found my Infocom CDs. Masterpieces, SciFi, and Fantasy collection"   
|  |  **zarf** says, "hey, cool"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "sweet"   
|  |  **zarf** says, "I have like three copies of Masterpieces but I never had the 'genre' collections"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "So if we're up for something long again, there's that."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "I should mention I've recently played Spellbreaker inside and out."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I have, honestly, never gotten past a certain point in Hitchhiker's."   
|  |  **kpaquette** says (to jacqueline), "Good thing I'm running out of games to play."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I am possiblly too familiar with Hitchhiker's to play it, but it'd be fun watching."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Oh, I'm open to whatever."   
**Draconis** says, "I'm also open to anything. I've played the Zork/Enchanter series a lot but none of the others as much."  |  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Honestly, a game where *I* just watched might be good. After CF I have kind of a taxing day ahead."   
**Draconis** says, "Er"  |  |  **Draconis** says, "I'm also open to anything. I've played the Zork/Enchanter series a lot but none of the others as much."   
|  |  **Draconis** says, "There we go"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I've never actually finished Zork"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I would freakin' love it if we played Zork, actually."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "That would cheer me up considerably."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "hm. I recently replayed "Yes, Another Game with a Dragon!""   
|  |  **DavidW** asks, "Zork or Zork I?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says (to DW), "I thought it was 'Yet Another Game with a Dragon'. huh"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "was it good?"   
|  |  **DavidW** says (to Jacqueline), "I thought so too."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I've been calling it the wrong thing all this time."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "YAGWAD is good, yes."   
|  |  **kpaquette** says, "I am a little bit too familiar with zork. I got to where the balloon takes off and then couldn't get any further."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "You're mostly exploring the forest rather than caves in YAGWAD."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I managed to get into the cave and found some treasures, but didn't get too far."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "hahaha - so I was being lazy, trying to find a list of what's on the Masterpieces CD without spinning around in my chair and finding the disc. I did a Google search. The top site is called Where to buy Infocom games and has a description 'Information on where Infocom games are available, especially the Masterpieces collection.' I clicked on it. It's a very long page with a lot of text but the answer to the question they pose could be summed up in one word: eBay."   
**Draconis** says, "If Jacq likes Zork that would be cool"  |  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I do like Zork. And I like people who speak on channel."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** laughs. "Sorry, Draconis, I couldn't resist."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Okay, let me load that up. One sec."   
**Draconis** says, "Gah"  |  |  **Draconis** says, "If Jacq likes Zork that would be cool"   
|  |  **Draconis** says, "There we go"   
|  |  **Draconis** says, "Just a moment, going to switch back to my usual client >>"   
DavidW says (to Floyd), "list z"  |  |   
**Floyd** says (to DavidW), "zazie zball zdungeon zebulon zero zfiles zilcloak zokoban zombie zombieexodus zombies zork1 zork2 zork3 zorkainstories1 zugzwang"  |  |  **Teaspoon** exclaims, "woo!"   
**DavidW** says, "zorks 1 to 3 are already on Floyd."  |  |  **DavidW** says, "zorks 1 to 3 are already on Floyd."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "And I think zdungeon is the full Zork."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Oh, of course they're already on Floyd."   
Teaspoon says (to Floyd), "load sleepmask zork1"  |  |

**Floyd** | The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the

**Floyd** | is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the

**Floyd** | Treasure Room
**Floyd** | This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of
**Floyd** | discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on
**Floyd** | the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.
**Floyd** | There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning
**Floyd** | against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.
**Floyd** | There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.
**Floyd** | Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
**Floyd** | The thief bows formally, raises his stiletto, and with a wry grin,
**Floyd** | ends the battle and your life.
**Floyd** | It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you
**Floyd** | are dead.

|  |  **DavidW** says, "oh my. Zork II: The Wizard of Frustration."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Here's a cool version of the maps that I don't think I'd ever seen before:"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Ooh. Is it worse?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | [[LINK](http://www.ironrealms.com/sites/default/files/zork-1-map.jpg)]   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I don't recall it being worse. Just different."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Each game is both related and a departure from the last."   
|  |  **DavidW** says (to Teaspoon), "You'll want to save often; I can tell you that."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Yes. That's true."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Even more than this one?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I remember a lot less of ZII than ZI."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "Zork III is the real change in tone."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Yea."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Very dark."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I like it, though."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "It may be my favorite of the lot."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I like the imagery in ZI and ZIII better than ZII. ZII is fun, though."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "well, III isn't so much darker in that it's got more purpose than finding treasures."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Yeah"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "...you know, I completely forgot you could go up the chimney in the studio. That would have saved a lot of time."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "heh"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Is that the one about the magic academy or whatever it is?"   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "Not everything goes up the chimney. The coffin doesn't."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "oh. So that's fine then."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Okay. I'll go work on posting this. See if I can get the #CF-Spoilers to integrate easily. If I can't, I'll just post a raw version that incorporates the spoiler channel for Teaspoon's amusement."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Heh. Thanks."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** exclaims, "Glad everyone enjoyed it as much as I did!"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "(Well, I hope everyone did. All that mapping.)"   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "I zoned out during the maze mapping."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Next time I will keep a Neat Map and then it would be more usable. Hopefuly."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "My original maps aren't neat in the slightest."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Entirely understandable."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "So is there a death where you go over the waterfall?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "There is, I believe."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "oh, I think so."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "You can probably also stand on the rainbow, wave the sceptre, and fall to your doom, i bet."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "There are a bunch of amusing things. Many of which you hit."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I would not have thought of that one, David."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "We're pretty sure the gunk was a liquid latex sort of emergency patch for the boat if it got punctured."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Here's the amusing list (small paste dump incoming...)"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Go down the chimney from the Kitchen.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Give various things to the troll, especially the nasty knife from the Attic.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Knock the troll unconscious (save a game so you can retry the battle until you accomplish this) and take his axe, then return it to him after he wakes up.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Say hello to, listen to, and take the troll and Cyclops.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Damage the painting (for example, by cutting or burning it).   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Read the matchbook.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Read the black book at the Altar.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Light the candles with the torch.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Burn the black book.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Try something naughty with the bodies in Hades.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Continue digging in the sand after you find the scarab. (save first)   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Wave the sceptre while standing on the rainbow. (save first)   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Enter the Gas Room with an open flame, such as the torch or candles.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Swear at Zork.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Cut something with the knife or sword.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Light something on fire (such as the pile of leaves), then pour water on it from the bottle.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Get killed after praying at the altar, then wait or score while a spirit.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Walk around the house or in the forest.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | Try these commands: Zork; xyzzy or plugh; chomp; win; lose; mumble or sigh; repent; yell or scream; bite myself; take myself; find, count, listen to, what is, and smell various things (house, hands, teeth, myself, candles, leaves, matches…).   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "It seemed to work all right but I'd abandoned the sword by then."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "You did quite a few of those."   
|  |  **DavidW** asks, "oh, was the acrostic noticed?"   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "I missed how the cyclops was defeated."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "There was an acoustic?"   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "acrostic."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I kept trying to light him on fire like in Homer,"   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "[[LINK](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Acrostic)]"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** exclaims, "Oh!"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I was wondering what the point of that was."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "No, I just knew my Greek myths."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "how can you score when you're incorporeal?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Ghosts have been asking themselves that since the beginning of time, I suspect."   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "I think you have to find Whoopi Goldberg."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "heh"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "So, who's made a game where you can fly to the British Museum?"   
**PerrySimm** goes home.  |  |   
|  |  **DavidW** says, "I don't know of a game like that."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Huh. I would have thought someone would have taken Infocom up on that joke."   
**Ellison** has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the Lounge.  |  |   
Teaspoon says (to Floyd), "restore"  |  |   
**Floyd** says (to Teaspoon), "Floyd doesn't know that trick."  |  |  **lno** says (to Jacqueline), "oh my a Zork Users Group"   
|  |  **lno** says, "could it be more 80s."   
**DavidW** says, "The game closed itself when you won."  |  |  **Teaspoon** says, "ah"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "That's all right then."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "heh"   
|  |  **lno** says, "also, suddenly I recall I had "plughY2" as a throwaway password somewhere, but now can't recall where"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I am enjoying the Invisclues"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** exclaims, "Oh, so that's what the gunk is for!"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Heh."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "What's it for?"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "To patch the pipes with when you make them leak by pressing the buttons."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "oHO"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "So, not the boat, then."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "So, yes, you were supposed to just press buttons and see what happens."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "(also the boat too)"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Oh, excellent."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "The timber was useless. Good."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "so for exits...six...we have the grating, the Strange passage, the Chimney, the Altar, the Rainbow Bridge..."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Say, what was the other one?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "The Cyclops hole - but that's the strange passage, right?"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "right."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "oh god, there's a passage between the temple and the Treasure room. Good lord."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "This is the version of the map with which I'm the most familiar (and on which I adore the font...)"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** | [[LINK](http://gallery.guetech.org/zork1_invisiclues/map-4-5-6-7.jpg)]   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "There is?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "A connection between the Temple and the Living Room, I mean?"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Granite"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "Oh, I see that on the map now. How do you activate it?"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Apparently if you say "granite" it'll teleport you from one to the other."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "bah"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "good grief"   
|  |  **DavidW** asks, "'granite' is written on the wall there, isn't it?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I think so, yeah."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "It is."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I just didn't think of saying it."   
|  |  Jacqueline) Jacqueline says, "But we just took it for granite."   
|  |   
******* EPILOGUE ***  |  |   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "wow, I spent forever mapping."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "heh. Yes."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "But that's okay. We just found other things to do while you were figuring out the mazes."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "I had heard about 1 maze. I had not known of the existence of 2."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Oh oh oh. I have an idea for next week."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Or right now."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Oh, what?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "Zork: A Troll's-Eye View"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I think it's very, very short."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** exclaims, "Oh, yes!"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "One room joke game."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Floydable?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "This week seems more appropriate."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** asks, "Yeah. Are you up for it?"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "Is it uploaded?"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I think."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I'm wondering if it's 'troll'"   
Jacqueline says (to Floyd), "load sleepmask troll"  |  |

**Floyd** |
**Floyd** | What if an adventurer came upon you unawares? Fine guard you'd be.
**Floyd** | A "lean and hungry" gentleman with a large bag just wandered through

**Floyd** | The Troll Room

|  |  **Jacqueline** | Another one-room joke game. You too can experience the boredom of a monster guarding a passageway!   
|  |  **Bishop** says, "I think if you're very, very lucky (or make profligate use of 'undo') you can get to the end of the day without dying."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** asks, "That so?"   
|  |  **Bishop** isn't in the room and is just guessing at how the game shook out.   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "I think you may be giving it more credit than is due, but perhaps."   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Feel free to try and tell us how it turns out"   
|  |  **Bishop** | A low-pitched siren, designed by the Frobozz Magic Siren Company especially to be inaudible to adventurers, echoes through the dungeon. Right on cue, your shift-change shambles into the room from the eastern passageway, axe swinging from his hand (and occasionally notching chips from his ankles). Time to clock off and meet up with the Thief and your foreman the Cyclops; you were just starting to get the hang of this game "poker" last night.   
|  |  **Bishop** | *** You have survived your first full day ***   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "Oh, well done."   
|  |  **Jacqueline** exclaims, "Nice! I take it all back, Dylan!"   
|  |  **Jacqueline** says, "There's more depth to the game than I gave it credit for!"   
|  |  **Teaspoon** says, "It's nice that there's a winning ending."
