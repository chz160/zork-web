    "text": "Useful commands:\n\n   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions\nfor rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses\nprinting of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'\ncommand restores long descriptions.\n   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea\nof what the game is about.\n   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish\nto continue playing.\n   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.\n   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.\n   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.\n   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.\n   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.\n   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.\n   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.\n\nCommand abbreviations:\n\n   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.\n   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.\n   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.\n\nContainment:\n\n   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can\nbe opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may\nnot be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object\nwhich is in a container, the container must be open.  For you\nto see such an object, the container must be either open or\ntransparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;\nthe number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their\nsizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be\nin your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program\nwill attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which\nprocess may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers\ncan contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than\none level down.\n\nFighting:\n\n   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when\nattacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.\nUseful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',\netc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a\nfighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,\ngetting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.\nStrength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to\nfight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details\nshould become apparent after a few melees or deaths.\n\nCommand parser:\n\n   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.\nFor reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their\nfirst six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing\n'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also\ncreates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-\ntion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.\n\n   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands\nthe following types of things--\n\n   Actions:\n\tAmong the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.\n\tFairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,\n\tPUT DOWN, etc.\n\n   Directions:\n\tNORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.\n\tOther more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in\n\tonly certain situations.\n\n   Objects:\n\tMost objects have names and can be referenced by them.\n\n   Adjectives:\n\tSome adjectives are understood and required when there are\n\ttwo objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,\n\tDOORs, BUTTONs).\n\n   Prepositions:\n\tIt may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but\n\tthe parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous\n\twithout.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON\n\tCAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.\n\tWhen a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR\n\tWITH DEMON' won't parse.\n\n   Sentences:\n\tThe parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-\n\ttions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)\n\tcan be placed on the same line.\n\n   Ambiguity:\n\tThe parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of\n\tactions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.\n\tIf there is only one possible object, the parser will assume\n\tthat it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.\n\tMost questions asked by the parser can be answered.",

    "text": "Welcome to Dungeon!\n\n   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast\nquantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.\nIn order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To\nreceive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy\ncase in the living room of the house.\n\n   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects\nwhich may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may\nneed sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,\nsince dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading\nmaterial is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it\nis rumored to be useful.\n\n   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.\nWhen you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a\ncertain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding\nthe object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure\nsafely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In\naddition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated\nwith visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,\nwhich you may do only twice.\n\n   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who\nlikes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the\nlight of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure\nrather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which\nyou have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste\nhe may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines\nhis take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-\nionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders\nthrough and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).",
